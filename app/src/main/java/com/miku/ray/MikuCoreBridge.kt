/**
 * Where the vendored MikuRay layer meets MikuBox's core.
 *
 * The vendored code is compiled inside `:mikuray-ui`, which cannot see the app
 * module where the mihomo core and its VPN service live. So the layer it needs
 * is declared here as an interface and the app registers its implementation at
 * startup — the direction of the dependency, not the shape of the code, is what
 * this exists to fix.
 *
 * The default implementation is inert, which keeps the UI previewable (and
 * testable) before the app has registered anything; a real start is refused
 * rather than pretended.
