/**
 * Keeps the vendored profile list and MikuBox's own store in step.
 *
 * MikuRay's home screen lists entries from its own store (`MmkvManager`), while
 * the profiles this app actually connects with live in [MihomoProfileStore].
 * Rather than teach either side about the other, the profiles are mirrored into
 * MikuRay's table under their own ids: the id is the storage key there, so a
 * selection made on MikuRay's screen is already a MikuBox profile id — which is
 * what lets the connect button start the tunnel the user picked.
 *
 * The mirrored entries are MikuRay's "custom config" type: MikuBox profiles are
 * whole mihomo configurations, not per-protocol server records, and the core
 * that consumes them is MikuBox's, not the one MikuRay would have started.
